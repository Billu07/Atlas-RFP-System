## üîí Security Notes

### Password Storage

**IMPORTANT:** The current implementation uses Base64 encoding for passwords, which is NOT secure for production.

**For Production, you MUST:**

1. Use proper password hashing (bcrypt, argon2)
2. Implement server-side authentication
3. Use secure session tokens
4. Add HTTPS enforcement

**Current Implementation (Development Only):**

- Passwords encoded with Base64
- Client-side validation only
- Session storage in browser
- **NOT production-ready!**

### Recommended Production Setup:

- Add Vercel serverless functions for authentication
- Use NextAuth.js or similar
- Implement proper password hashing
- Add email verification
- Use HTTP-only cookies

---

## üìù File Upload Considerations

### Current Implementation:

- File name is stored in Airtable
- Actual file is NOT uploaded (needs implementation)
- Admin must manually collect signed NDAs

### Production Implementation Options:

**Option 1: Cloud Storage (Recommended)**

1. Set up AWS S3, Cloudinary, or Uploadcare
2. Upload files from vendor-signup.js
3. Store file URL in Airtable
4. Admin can download from Airtable

**Option 2: Airtable Attachments**

1. Upload to temporary storage first
2. Get public URL
3. Store in Airtable attachment field
4. Airtable stores the file

**Option 3: Email-Based**

1. Email signed NDA to admin
2. Admin manually uploads to Airtable
3. Update NDA status

---

## üé® Customization Guide

### Branding

**Update company name:**

```javascript
// config.js
branding: {
  companyName: "Your Company Name";
}
```

**Update logos:**

- Replace `/assets/images/logo.png`
- Update all references in HTML files

### Email Notifications

**Add email on registration:**

```javascript
// vendor-signup.js, line 180
// After successful registration:
await sendEmail({
  to: vendorData.companyInfo.email,
  subject: "Registration Received",
  body: "Thank you for registering...",
});
```

**Add email on approval:**

```javascript
// admin.js, line ~320
// After approving vendor:
await sendEmail({
  to: vendor.fields["Email"],
  subject: "Vendor Approved",
  body: "You have been approved...",
});
```

Use: SendGrid, Mailgun, or Vercel Email Integration

### NDA Workflow

**Alternative: Skip NDA Upload**

- Remove step 2 from signup.html
- Remove NDA upload logic
- Just require checkbox agreement
- Admin manually handles NDAs

**Alternative: Use DocuSign**

- Integrate DocuSign API
- Send NDA for e-signature
- Automatically update status
- Store in Airtable
